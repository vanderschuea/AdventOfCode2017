# AdventOfCode2017

These are simply my solutions for the Advent of Code (2017) problems written in python 3.5 :)

Each folder contains the two solutions for that day (each in a separate file in case you 
don't want to spoil part II and just want a starting point). The first part is stored in 
the files *_1.py, the second one in the other file. The *.txt files are my inputs (replace 
them with yours).
